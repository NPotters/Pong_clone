# Pong_clone
Space Pong

This is a Pong clone based on the Tutorial "Game From Scratch C++ and SFML Edition!" ( https://gamefromscratch.com/game-from-scratch-c-and-sfml-edition/ )
I started this project to freshen up and expand my knowledge on C++ and SFML.
Also I updated the code for SFML 2.5.1 and VS 2019.
Aditionally I gave it my own twist and will be updating it regulary until the end of the Tutorial.
The Textures are created and edited with Inkscape.
